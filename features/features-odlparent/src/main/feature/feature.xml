    <!-- These are additional features with non-standard (upstream) versions,
         provided for backwards-compatibility; they are now deprecated. For
         backwards-compatibility we need to preserve the feature name and
         version; once these are unused, we should re-introduce the features
         with odlparent versions rather than upstream versions (features with
         upstream versions belong upstream). -->
    <!-- TODO Migrate these features away from upstream versions -->
    <!-- TODO Replace the versioned features with these, using single-feature-parent -->
    <!-- (In both cases, we need to determine whether it makes sense to use
         unversioned features, in terms of the feasability of handling upgrades
         later.) -->
