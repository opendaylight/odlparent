      "message": "This is related to #2 from the commit message... But I\u0027d rather get this change merged ASAP, one way or another - because currently the SFT under Karaf 4 is really badly broken; e.g. the Karaf 4 feature build of infrautils takes 1/2h - doing nothing, did you know?  Later we can look at those classpath issues with the SFT... PS: I have a feeling we may be able to significantly simplify something related to that - IMHO we\u0027re currently making a bit of a mess of the SFT CP for Pax Exam.. a cleaner CP split of may be possible.  But I\u0027d like to only take that up separately \"later\", once this is in so that SFT under Karaf 4 isn\u0027t just so completely broken as it currently is.",
