The jar is also included in test scope. One other thing is sometimes these are included statically with: \u003cEmbed-Dependency\u003eutils.mdsal-openflow;type\u003d!pom;inline\u003dfalse\u003c/Embed-Dependency\u003e\n\nwrappedBundle(mavenBundle(\n\"org.opendaylight.netvirt\", \"utils.mdsal-openflow\")                                .version(asInProject())                                .type(\"jar\"))",
