           borderline insane. As an example: it flags org.osgi.framework.BundleContext as a mutable object (presumably
           because of addListener()) and you just cannot store a reference in the field without a corresponding
           @SuppressFBWarnings. -->

           As described in https://spotbugs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/bugDescriptions.html#ct-be-wary-of-letting-constructors-throw-exceptions-ct-constructor-throw,
           CT_CONSTRUCTOR_THROW is design to mitigate finalize()-based attacks.

           While the effert is commendable, Object.finalize() is its way out:
           - it was deprecated in Java 9, see https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8165641
           - it was deprecated for removal in Java 18, see https://openjdk.org/jeps/421

           It seems counter-productive to chase fixing this issue while we are also moving to a world where the
           problem can be mitigated with a global JVM switch (disable-finalization), especially if it involves
           "clever use of a private constructor".
