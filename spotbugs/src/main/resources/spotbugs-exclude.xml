      <!-- https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs/issues/511. Strict reading of Object.equals() contract means that
           evenever equals() behaviour is defined, all implementations need to adhere to it. The only reason
           to override the method (assuming correct API design, of course) is to provide a more efficient
           implementation. This rule would be forcing a @SuppressFBWarnings on perfectly compliant classes. -->

      <!-- https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs/issues/1601. The new heuristics for determining mutability are
           borderline insane. As an example: it flags org.osgi.framework.BundleContext as a mutable object (presumably
           because of addListener()) and you just cannot store a reference in the field without a corresponding
           @SuppressFBWarnings. -->
