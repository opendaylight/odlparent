ODL Parent release notes
========================

Version 7.0.2
-------------
This is a security/bug-fix upgrade from version 7.0.1.


Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Infrastructure for identifying confidential log messages was added, along with
  Karaf configuration update to routing such messages into a separate log file.
  See `ODLPARENT-231 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-231>`__ for details.

* Netty has been disconnected from Javassist way back in its 4.1.9 release, but
  we failed to notice. This has now been rectified by ``odl-netty-4`` not depending
  on ``odl-javassist-3``.

Version 7.0.1
-------------
This is a bug-fix upgrade from version 7.0.0.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
* Upgrade of ``maven-javadoc-plugin`` is causing issues in downstream javadoc jobs and therefore it has been reverted.
  See `ODLPARENT-229 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-229>`__ for details.

  * `1.21.0 <https://www.eclipse.org/xtend/releasenotes.html#/releasenotes/2020/03/03/version-2-21-0>`__

Version 7.0.0
-------------
This is a major upgrade from version 6, with breaking changes; downstream projects may need to make changes to upgrade
to this version.

Property removals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ``enforcer.version`` and ``projectinfo`` properties were removed. These properties do not serve any legal purpose as
  the plugins referenced by them are declared in ``pluginManagement`` section.

Upstream version removals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following upstream dependencies have been removed from dependency management:

* ``immutables.org/value`` without ``<classifier>annotations</classifier>``

* ``javax.xml.bind/jaxb-api``, replaced with ``jakarta.xml.bind/jakarta.xml.bind-api``

* ``com.google.inject/guice``

* ``com.mycila.guice.extensions/mycila-guice-jsr250``

* ``org.apache.shiro/shiro-core``

* ``org.apache.shiro/shiro-web``

Feature removals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ``odl-akka-leveldb-0.10`` feature was removed. This feature provided leveldb-backed implementation of Akka
  Persistence, which is not supported for production environments by upstream. Furthermore this feature relied on a
  custom-built binary, which we do not have a means to reproduce -- limiting our portability. The controller project,
  which is the only downstream user of persistence provides an alternative implementation, hence we are removing this
  historical baggage. See `ODLPARENT-213 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-213>`__ for details.

* ``odl-caffeine-2`` feature was removed. This feature provided a ``JSR-107 JCache`` implementation, an API deemed to
  be problematic where high-performance and correctness in required.

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* OSGi R6 Declarative Services enabled in Karaf. The ``scr`` feature is now part of startup features, hence Service
  Component Runtime can be used without incurring an additional refresh.
  See `ODLPARENT-227 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-227>`__ for details.

Version 6.0.3
-------------
This is a bug-fix upgrade from version 6.0.2.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
* The fix for `ODLPARENT-216 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-216>`__ ended up
  breaking ``org.kohsuke.metainf-services`` integration. While this could be fixed in downstreams
  by adding proper </annotationProcessorPaths> entry, it is a regression from 6.0.1.

Version 6.0.2
-------------
This is a security/bug-fix upgrade from version 6.0.1.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
* ``single-feature-parent`` was setting up Karaf repositories incorrectly, leading to
  the test using unpatched Karaf resources. This has now been fixed and the test run
  is using environment equivalent to the contents of the distribution. See
  `ODLPARENT-209 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-209>`__ for details.

* ``immutables.org`` integration relied on pre-JDK9 way of integration, where the annotation processor
  was just dropped as a dependency. This does not work with JDK9+ artifacts which are also explicit
  JMPS modules. Note that users are advised to switch to depending on the ``annotations``-classified
  artifact. See `ODLPARENT-216 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-216>`__ for details.

* Assembled Karaf distribution did not perform proper JDK checks and allowed launching with JDK8,
  leading to a failure to install OpenDaylight components with an error stack, which confuses users
  not familiar with OSGi. The distribution now refuses to start with anything other than JDK11. See
  `ODLPARENT-218 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-218>`__ for details.

-------------

  has now been fixed and the URL handling has been revised to fix build on Windows. See
  `ODLPARENT-214 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-214>`__ for details.

* ``leveldb-jni`` jar, which has been seeded to nexus.opendaylight.org long time ago is not published
  in Maven Central. This has been resolved by repackaging this jar and publishing it from odlparent.

Version 6.0.0
-------------
This is a major upgrade from version 5, with breaking changes; projects will
need to make changes to upgrade to this version.

Java 11 is required
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This release sets ``maven.compiler.release=11`` and enforces that the JDK used to build
is Java 11+. As there may be issues with various maven plugins when faced with JDK9+
constructs and JDK11+ classes, target release can be controlled on a per-artifact
basis (i.e. target Java 10 with ``maven.compiler.release=10`` property).

This release has been validated with ``openjdk-11.0.4`` and is not supported on any lower
version. As usual, we recommend using latest available JDK/JRE for Java 11 during development
and deployment.

Checkstyle/SpotBugs/Modernizer run by default
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With this release code artifacts always run ``maven-checkstyle-plugin``, ``spotbugs-maven-plugin``
and ``modernizer-maven-plugin``. Checkstyle and SpotBugs run in enforcing mode, i.e. will fail
build if any violations are found. Modernizer is configured to report Java 8-compatible constructs
and will not fail the build unless instructed to do so.

Behavior of each of these is controlled via a maven property on a per-artifact basis:

* ``odlparent.checkstyle.enforce`` controls checkstyle enforcement: defaults to ``true``, but can be set to ``false``
* ``odlparent.checkstyle.skip`` controls checkstyle invocation: defaults to ``false``, but can be set to ``true``
* ``odlparent.spotbugs.enforce`` controls SpotBugs enforcement: defaults to ``true``, but can be set to ``false``
* ``odlparent.spotbugs.skip`` controls SpotBugs invocation: defaults to ``false``, but can be set to ``true``
* ``odlparent.modernizer.enforce`` controls modernizer enforcement: defaults to ``false``, but can be set to ``true``
* ``odlparent.modernizer.skip`` controls modernizer invocation: defaults to ``false``, but can be set to ``true``
* ``odlparent.modernizer.target`` controls modernizer Java version: defaults to ``1.8``, but can be set to ``1.11`` or similar

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* ``blueprint container`` had ``org.apache.aries.blueprint.preemptiveShutdown`` set to false
  to enable it to work with Config Subsystem. As that component is long gone, this property has
  been removed as part of `ODLPARENT-34 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-34>`__.
  Furthermore, system properties related to Config Subsystem/NETCONF integration have been removed
  as well.

New plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``modernizer-maven-plugin`` declared, allowing downstreams to more easily activate it,
  and so detect code which should be updated to more modern equivalent.

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``odl-caffeine-2`` provides a pre-packaged feature for the Caffeine caching framework,
  along with the Guava compabitility layer.

Version 5.0.0
-------------

This is a major upgrade from version 4, with breaking changes; projects will
need to make changes to upgrade to this version.

The most significant change is `ODLPARENT-198 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-198>`__,
which removes JSR305 from default dependencies and does not present it at class path by default.

Deleted artifacts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``findbugs`` has been removed, as its only purpose was to provide FindBugs
rule definitions. Equivalent definitions are available in ``spotbugs``.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* ``blueprint-maven-plugin`` used to scan the entire classpath, resulting in potential conflicts
  across projects. Scanning is now limited to ``${project.groupId}``, limiting conflict domain
  to single project. See `ODLPARENT-109 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-109>`__.

* ``bundle-maven-plugin`` configuration ignored generated ServiceLoader service entries,
  which has now been fixed. See `ODLPARENT-197 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-197>`__.

* Bundle tests are now enabled by default. See `ODLPARENT-158 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-158>`__
  and `ODLPARENT-80 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-80>`__ for details.

* Karaf log file rollover was not explictly set up, leading to inability to easily override
  the defaults. See `ODLPARENT-153 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-153>`__ for details.

* Karaf log file used to use default maximum 16MiB file size, this has now been increased to 64MiB.
  See `ODLPARENT-154 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-154>`__.

* ``features-test`` excluded opendaylight-karaf-empty's transitive dependencies, leading
  to the need to re-declare them in single-feature-parent. This re-declaration was forgotten
  in for ``bcpkix-framework-ext`` and ``bcprov-framework-ext`` bundles, which lead to them
  not being present in the local repository. See `ODLPARENT-130 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-130>`__.

* spotbugs-maven-plugin 3.1.8 → 3.1.11

Version 4.0.9
-------------

This is a bug-fix upgrade from version 4.0.8.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* ``karaf-plugin`` invocation in ``karaf4-parent`` caused previously
  patched features to be overwritten with their stock versions, referencing
  bundles which were not populated in the local repository. (See
  `ODLPARENT-194 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-194>`__.)

* ``karaf-plugin`` version in ``karaf4-parent`` is now provided through
  plugin management so downstreams can override it without needing
  to repeat its configuration.

* ``karaf-plugin`` no longer reads features twice when running discovery,
  speeding up the process a bit.

* Recent versions of the SpotBugs Maven plugin use SLF4J 1.8 beta 2, which
  can’t use the 1.7.25 implementation we provide; we therefore provide an
  implementation of 1.8 beta 2 when SpotBugs is used. (See
  `ODLPARENT-184 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-184>`__.)

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``odl-woodstox`` wraps the Woodstox StAX implementation which is imposed on
  us by Karaf.

Version 4.0.8
-------------

This is a bug-fix and minor upstream bump upgrade from version 4.0.7.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* ``bcprov-ext-jdk15on`` is a superset of ``bcprov-jdk15on``, so there’s no
  need to ship both; we now only ship the former. In addition, we install the
  Bouncy Castle JARs in ``lib/boot`` so that they continue to be available on
  the boot classpath (JDK 9 removes the extension mechanism which was used
  previously), and provide the corresponding bundles from the boot classpath
  instead of using separate JARs in the system repository. (See
  `ODLPARENT-183 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-183>`__ and
  `ODLPARENT-185 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-185>`__.)

* A dependency check has been added to ensure that we don’t run into the
  TrieMap dependency bug in 4.0.6 again.

* Dependencies pulled in by features are now checked for convergence, and
  ``karaf-plugin`` warns when it finds diverging dependencies (the same
  artifact with two different versions). Upstream-provided features are
  patched to avoid the following divergences (and upgrade some dependencies in
  the process):

  * Aries utilities 1.1.0/1.1.3 (upgraded to 1.1.3).
  * Commons Beanutils 1.8.3/1.9.3 (upgraded to 1.9.3).
  * Commons Codec 1.8/1.10 (upgraded to 1.11).
  * ``javax.mail`` 1.4.4/1.4.7 (upgraded to 1.4.7).

  (See `ODLPARENT-189 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-189>`__.)

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``odl-dropwizard-metrics`` provides Dropwizard Metrics (which are also
  available in dependency management).

* ``enunciate-maven-plugin`` is added as the replacement for
  ``maven-enunciate-plugin``.

Third-party dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following dependencies are no longer provided by the JVM, starting with
version 11, but we make them available via dependency management for projects
which need them:

* ``javax.annotation-api``.

* JAXB (``jaxb-core``, ``jaxb-impl``).

The following dependencies have been upgraded:

* Checkstyle `8.15 → 8.16 <https://checkstyle.org/releasenotes.html#Release_8.16>`__.

* Dependency Check `4.0.0 → 4.0.2 <https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.md>`__.

* ``git-commit-id`` `2.2.5 → 2.2.6 <https://github.com/ktoso/maven-git-commit-id-plugin/releases>`__.

* Immutables 2.7.1 → 2.7.3:

  * `2.7.2 <https://github.com/immutables/immutables#272-2018-11-05>`__.
  * `2.7.3 <https://github.com/immutables/immutables#273-2018-11-10>`__.

  (2.7.4 breaks our Javadocs.)

* Jackson `2.9.7 → 2.9.8 <https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.9.8>`__.

Version 4.0.7
-------------

This is a bug-fix release, correcting the ``triemap`` import declaration.

Version 4.0.6
-------------

This is a bug-fix and minor upstream packaging upgrade from version 4.0.5.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

Single-feature-test was broken with JDK 9 and later and Karaf 4.2.2; this
release adds the additional JVM configuration needed.

Third-party dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release adds the ``triemap`` BOM to dependency management.

Version 4.0.5
-------------

This is a bug-fix release: the Karaf Maven plugin, in version 4.2.2, is
`broken <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KARAF-6057>`__ in some cases we
need in OpenDaylight; we revert to 4.2.1 in ``karaf4-parent`` to avoid this.

Version 4.0.4
-------------

This is a bug-fix release, reverting the change made in 4.0.3 to handle
building with either ``zip`` or ``tar.gz`` Karaf archives (which breaks
builds in our infrastructure, without the empty Karaf archive).

Version 4.0.3
-------------

This is a bug-fix and minor upstream bump upgrade from version 4.0.2.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* Our FindBugs configuration for JDK 9 and later caused the plugin to run
  everywhere; instead, this version defines the ``findbugs.skip`` property to
  disable the plugin in modules where it would be used otherwise.

* The PowerMock declarations in dependency management missed
  ``powermock-api-mockito2``, which is necessary for modules using PowerMock
  with Mockito 2.

* The “quick” profile (``-Pq``) now skips SpotBugs.

* JSR-305 annotations are now optional, which fixes a number of issues when
  building with newer JDKs.

* We provide JAXB with JDK 11 and later (where it is no longer provided by the
  base platform).

* ``odlparent-artifacts`` has been updated to accurately represent the
  artifacts provided.

* ``javax.activation`` is now excluded from generated features (it’s provided
  on Karaf’s boot classpath).

* When the build is configured to build Karaf distributions in ``tar.gz``
  archives, but not ``zip`` archives, ``features-test`` used to fail; it will
  now used whichever is available
  (`ODLPARENT-174 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-174>`__).

* Explicit GCs are disabled by default, so that calls to ``System.gc()`` are
  ignored
  (`ODLPARENT-175 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-175>`__).

* Null checks are disabled in SpotBugs because of bad interactions with newer
  annotations and the bytecode produces by JDK 11 and later for
  ``try``-with-resources.

* Akka Persistence expects LevelDB 0.10, so we now pull in that version
  instead of 0.7.

Dependency convergence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A number of dependencies have been added or constrained so that projects using
this parent can enforce dependency convergence:

* Karaf’s ``framework`` feature is used as an import POM, so that we converge
  by default on the versions used in Karaf.

* The following dependencies have been added to dependency management:

  * ``commons-beanutils``
  * the Checker Framework
  * Error Prone annotations
  * ``javax.activation``
  * ``xml-apis``

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following Karaf features have been added:

* ``odl-antlr4`` (providing ``antlr4-runtime``);

* ``odl-gson`` (providing ``gson``);

* ``odl-jersey-2`` (providing Jersey client, server, and container servlet,
  along with the necessary feature dependencies);

* ``odl-servlet-api`` (providing ``javax.servlet-api``);

* ``odl-stax2-api`` (providing ``stax2-api``);

* ``odl-ws-rs-api`` (providing ``javax.ws.rs-api``);

A new ``sonar-jacoco-aggregate`` profile can be used to produce Sonar reports
with aggregated JaCoCo reports. Additionally, Sonar builds (run with
``-Dsonar``) are detected and run with a number of irrelevant plugins disabled.

Version 4.0.2
-------------

This is a bug-fix and minor upstream bump upgrade from version 4.0.1.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

Previous releases overrode Karaf’s ``jre.properties``; this is no longer
necessary, and was causing failures with Java 9 and later (our version of
``jre.properties`` didn’t have the appropriate settings for anything after
Java 8). This release drops that override. See

Version 4.0.1
-------------

This is a bug-fix and minor upstream bump upgrade from version 4.0.0.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

The JaCoCo execution profile was incorrect, breaking Sonar; the report is now
written correctly, so that Sonar can find it.

The Blueprint Maven plugin fails when it encounters Java 9 classes; this is
fixed by forcefully upgrading its dependency on xbean-finder. See
`ODLPARENT-167 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-167>`__ for

Version 4.0.0
-------------

This is a major upgrade from version 3, with breaking changes; projects will
need to make changes to upgrade to this version.

`This Wiki page <https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Neon_platform_upgrade>`__
has detailed step-by-step migration instructions.

ODL Parent 4 requires Maven 3.5.3 or later; this is needed in particular to
enable SpotBugs support with current versions of the SpotBugs plugin.

Known issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release’s SpotBugs support doesn’t handle Guava 25.1 correctly, resulting
in false-positives regarding null handling; see
`ODLPARENT-161 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-161>`__ for
details. Until this is fixed, the corresponding warnings are disabled, which
matches our existing FindBugs configuration (which suffers from the a variant
of this, with the same consequences).

We are planning on upgrading Akka during the 4.x cycle, even if it results in
a technically breaking upgrade. This is currently blocked on an OSGi bug in
Akka; see `Akka issue 25579 <https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/25579>`__ for
details.

Blueprint and OSGi service handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previous releases used an OpenDaylight-specific directory for Blueprint XML
files, ``org/opendaylight/blueprint``. It turned out this wasn’t useful, so
version 4 uses the default directory, ``OSGI-INF/blueprint``.

The Maven bundle plugin is now configured to omit the ``Import-Service`` and
``Export-Service`` headers, since they are deprecated, unnecessary in
OpenDaylight, and liable to cause issues.

With previous releases of OpenDaylight, projects were encouraged to use Pax
CDI API annotations to describe their Blueprint beans, services and injections;
with version 4, Blueprint annotations should be used instead:

* modules should depend on
  ``org.apache.aries.blueprint:blueprint-maven-plugin-annotation``, with the
  ``<optional>true</optional>`` flag, instead of
  ``org.ops4j.pax.cdi:pax-cdi-api``;

* ``@OsgiServiceProvider`` on bean definitions is replaced by ``@Service``;

* ``@OsgiService`` at injection points is replaced by ``@Reference``;

* ``@OsgiService`` on bean definitions, while technically wrong, can be seen in
  the OpenDaylight codebase; this is replaced by ``@Service``;

* service lists can be injected using ``@ReferenceList``.

See `this Gerrit patch <https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/75699>`__ for an
example.

Compiler settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Builds now warn about unchecked type uses (such as raw types where generics
are available).

JUnit and Mockito are always available as test dependencies and no longer need
to be declared in POMs.

New build profiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An OWASP profile is now available to run OWASP’s dependency checker; this will
check all third-party dependencies against the NVD vulnerability database. To
enable this, run Maven with ``-Powasp``.

Build profile changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``-Pq`` now skips Modernizer.

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

``odl-akka-leveldb-0.10`` wraps LevelDB 0.10 for Akka.

``odl-apache-commons-codec`` wraps Apache Commons Codec.

``odl-apache-commons-lang3`` wraps Apache Commons Lang 3.

``odl-apache-commons-net`` wraps Apache Commons Net.

``odl-apache-commons-text`` wraps Apache Commons Text.

``odl-apache-sshd`` wraps Apache SSHD.

``odl-guava`` provides the default ODL version of Guava; it should be used
instead of ``odl-guava-23`` or the new ``odl-guava-25``.

``odl-jackson-2.9`` wraps Jackson 2.9.

New FindBugs and SpotBugs settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FindBugs and SpotBugs are configured with
`the SLF4J extension <http://kengotoda.github.io/findbugs-slf4j/>`__ (version
1.4.0 for FindBugs, 1.4.1 for SpotBugs). This will flag misused SLF4J calls, in
particular message templates which don’t match the arguments, and invalid
placeholders (*e.g.* ``%s`` instead of ``{}``).

Deleted artifacts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``aggregator-parent`` was unusable outside ``odlparent`` and has been removed.
Instead, the ``maven.deploy.skip`` and ``maven.install.skip`` properties are
available to disable deploying and installing artifacts.

Upstream version upgrades
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Blueprint annotations (``org.apache.aries.blueprint:blueprint-maven-plugin-annotation``).

* Log4J2.

* Pax Web 7.2.3 (synchronised with Karaf).

Upstream version removals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following upstream dependencies have been removed from dependency management:

* Google Protobuf.

* Our repackaging of Jersey Servlet.

* JUnit’s ``junit-dep``, which has long been obsolete.

* LevelDB (which is still available as features).

* Pax CDI API — Blueprint annotations should be used instead.

Plugin version upgrades
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following plugins have been upgraded:

* Blueprint 1.4.0 → 1.10.0.

* Build helper 1.12 → 3.0.0.

* Bundle plugin 3.5.0 → 4.0.0.

* Checkstyle
  `2.17 → 3.0.0 <https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/maven-announce/201801.mbox/%3Cop.zchs68akkdkhrr%40desktop-2khsk44.mshome.net%3E>`__.

* Duplicate finder
  `1.2.1 → 1.3.0 <https://github.com/basepom/duplicate-finder-maven-plugin/blob/master/CHANGES.md>`__.

* Git commit id `2.2.4 → 2.2.5 <https://github.com/ktoso/maven-git-commit-id-plugin/releases/tag/v2.2.5>`__.

* Jacoco Maven plugin `0.8.1 → 0.8.2 <https://github.com/jacoco/jacoco/releases/tag/v0.8.2>`__.

* Javadoc `3.0.0 → 3.0.1 <https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317529&version=12342283>`__.

* PMD 3.8 → 3.10.0:

  * `3.10.0 <https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=12342689&styleName=Text&projectId=12317621>`__.

* SpotBugs 3.1.0-RC6 → 3.1.6 (see the SpotBugs changes above).

Version 3.1.3
-------------

This version fixes the following issues:

* `ODLPARENT-156 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-156>`_:
  ``xtend-maven-plugin``’s dependencies end up pulling in conflicting
  dependencies. ODL Parent now constrains part of its dependency tree to avoid
  this.

This version adds ``odl-jackson-2.8`` to ``odlparent-artifacts``.

Version 3.1.2
-------------

This version fixes the following issues:

* `INFRAUTILS-41 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/INFRAUTILS-41>`_:
  ``jre.properties`` includes ``com.sun.management`` so that it can be
  enabled if necessary. (This doesn’t add a dependency on
  ``com.sun.management``, it allows bundles to use it if it is present.)

* `ODLPARENT-136 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-136>`_:
  ``SingleFeatureTest`` pulls in ``org.osgi.compendium``.

* `ODLPARENT-144 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-144>`_:
  ``org.apache.karaf.scr.management`` is whitelisted so that it no longer
  affects ``SingleFeatureTest``.

* `ODLPARENT-146 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-146>`_:
  null-related FindBugs checks which produce false-positives with Guava 23.6
  and later are disabled, so that this really is fully backwards-compatible
  with 3.0 and later.

* `ODLPARENT-148 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-148>`_:
  ``SingleFeatureTest`` preserves ``target/SFT/karaf.log``.

This version includes the following improvements:

* ``custom.properties`` no longer includes OVSDB-specific configuration.

* The ``odl-jersey-1`` feature includes the Jersey client.

* Redundant bundle dependency declarations in ``SingleFeatureTest`` have been
  removed (these are declarations which are also present in our base Karaf
  distribution).

* Build errors involving invalid feature or bundle URLs now indicate which
  feature is at fault.

* Obsolete Log4J overrides have been removed from ``SingleFeatureTest``.

When building using JDK 9 or 10, the default settings have been changed as
follows to avoid errors or extraneous warnings:

* SFT is disabled (it needs Karaf 4.2 or later);

* Javadocs are generated as HTML 4;

* SpotBugs is disabled on JDK 10 or later;

* FindBugs is disabled on JDK 9 or later.

The following third-party dependencies have been upgraded:

* `EclipseLink Moxy JAXB 2.6.2 → 2.7.1 <https://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/releases/2.7.php>`_.

* `Google Truth 0.36 → 0.40 <https://github.com/google/truth/releases>`_.

* `Gson 2.8.2 → 2.8.5 <https://github.com/google/gson/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md>`_.

* `Guava 23.6 → 23.6.1 <https://github.com/google/guava/compare/v23.6...v23.6.1>`_.
  This addresses CVE-2018-10237 (that’s the only change in this release).

* `Jacoco Maven plugin 0.8.0 → 0.8.1 <https://github.com/jacoco/jacoco/releases/tag/v0.8.1>`_.

* JDT annotations 2.1.0 → 2.1.150.

* `Scala 2.12.5 → 2.12.6 <https://github.com/scala/scala/releases/tag/v2.12.6>`_.

* `Scala Parser Combinators 1.0.6 → 1.0.7 <https://github.com/scala/scala-parser-combinators/releases/tag/v1.0.7>`_.

* `Sevntu 1.24.2 → 1.29.0 <https://sevntu-checkstyle.github.io/sevntu.checkstyle/#1.29.0>`_.

* `Xtext and Xtend 2.13.0 → 2.14.0 <https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/blob/website-master/xtend-website/_posts/releasenotes/2018-05-23-version-2-14-0.md>`_.

The following Maven plugin has been upgraded:

* `Javadoc 3.0.0 → 3.0.1 <https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317529&version=12342283>`_.

Version 3.1.1
-------------

This version fixes the following issues:

* `ODLPARENT-137 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-137>`_:
  restore the OpenDaylight prompt.

* `ODLPARENT-146 <https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-146>`_:
  Guava 23.6 switched from @Nullable to @NullableDecl, which causes false
  positives in FindBugs’ ``NP_NONNULL_PARAM_VIOLATION`` rule; we’re
  disabling the rule for now.

Version 3.1.0
-------------

This version fixes the following issues:

* Mycila dependencies are now “compile” scoped rather than “test”; this allows
  child projects to use Guice with Mycila more easily.

* The duplicate finder now ignores ``web.xml`` and BluePrint XML files.

This version includes the following improvements:

* The ``-Pq`` profile skips Maven Modernizer, in preparation for its future
  integration (and its use in child projects).

* An OWASP profile, ``-Powasp`` is available for vulnerability checking.

* A new ``odl-jackson-2.8`` feature provides Jackson 2.8 to child projects.

The following third-party dependencies have been added to dependency management:

* `ThreeTen-Extra <http://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/>`_

  * `2.2.4 <https://github.com/ktoso/maven-git-commit-id-plugin/releases/tag/v2.2.4>`_

Version 3.0.3
-------------

This version fixes the following issues:

* `ODLPARENT-136`_: ``features-test`` needs ``org.osgi.compendium``.

* Jackson dependencies are declared using ``jackson-bom`` to ensure all they
  remain consistent.

* ``find-duplicate-classpath-entries`` is run in the “verify” phase rather than
  the “validate” phase, which is too early.

* The version of Jetty we pull in is now aligned with that declared in Karaf,
  resolving a number of restart and dependency issues.

* Pulling in the ``wrap`` feature unconditionally is no longer necessary, so
  ``karaf4-parent`` no longer does so.

* ``metainf-services`` are declared with scope “provided” to avoid their being
  included in downstream features (it’s a build-time dependency only).

* ``leveldb-api`` is excluded from ``odl-akka-leveldb-0.7``, and ``jsr250-api``
  from ``enunciate-core-annotations``, to avoid duplicate having classes on the
  classpath.

* Since the ``ssh`` feature is excluded from generated features, our Karaf
  need to enable it at boot in all cases.

* ``bundle-test-lib`` is now a bundle.

* Since we use static SLF4J loggers, the ``SLF4J_LOGGER_SHOULD_BE_NON_STATIC``
  rule needs to be disabled in our FindBugs configuration (this allows
  downstream projects to enable ``findbugs-slf4j`` without having to deal with
  all the resulting false-positives).

* ``org.apache.karaf.scr.management`` is white-listed in SFT to avoid failures
  apparently related to that component (which we don’t care about).

.. _ODLPARENT-136: https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-136

This version upgrades the following third-party dependencies:

* `Antlr 4.7 → 4.7.1`_

* `BouncyCastle 1.58 → 1.59`_

* Jersey 1.17 → 1.19.4 (additionally available as the ``odl-jersey-1`` feature)

* Jolokia 1.3.7 → 1.5.0

.. _Karaf 4.1.5: https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12311140&version=12342294

Version 3.0.2
-------------

This version fixes the following issues:

* SingleFeatureTest uses the configured local Maven repository for Pax Exam.

* JavaDoc links are disabled for now to `speed up builds`_. A new
  ``javadoc-links`` profile enables the links.

* Conditional feature dependencies are processed, ensuring our
  `distribution is complete`_.

* Startup features are `adjusted for Karaf 4.1`_, avoiding unnecessary
  refreshes.

* The ``hiddenField`` Checkstyle check is disabled for abstract methods.

* The default logging configuration uses Log4J2, which is the new default in
  Karaf 4.1.

.. _distribution is complete: https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-133
.. _adjusted for Karaf 4.1: https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/ODLPARENT-134

This version upgrades the following dependencies or plugins:

* ``maven-javadoc-plugin`` 3.0.0-M1 → 3.0.0

Version 3.0.1
-------------

This version fixes the following issues:

* Karaf pulls in an invalid Hibernate feature repository, breaking downstream
  dependencies pulling in the “war” feature. ``populate-local-repo`` corrects
  the repository dependency.


Version 3.0.0
-------------

Compiler settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Build now show compiler warnings and deprecation warnings. This doesn't affect
the result or require any changes currently, it just makes the issues more
visible.

New Checkstyle rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Checkstyle has been upgraded from 7.6 to 8.4 (see the
`Checkstyle release notes`_ for details), and Sevntu from 1.21.0 to 1.24.2
(note that the latter's group identifier changed from
``com.github.sevntu.checkstyle`` to ``com.github.sevntu-checkstyle``; you
might need to update your IDE's configuration).

The following Checkstyle rules are enabled; this might require changes in
projects which enforce Checkstyle validation:

* `AvoidHidingCauseExceptionCheck`_
* `FinalClass`_: utility classes must be declared ``final``
* `HiddenField`_: fields must not be shadowed
* `HideUtilityClassConstructor`_: utility classes must hide their constructor

Karaf
~~~~~

Karaf has been upgraded to 4.1.3. This should be transparent for dependent
projects.

Karaf distributions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* When building a Karaf distribution using ``karaf4-parent``, projects can
  specify which archives to build: the ``karaf.archiveZip`` property will
  enable ZIP files if true, and ``karaf.archiveTarGz`` will enable
  gzip-compressed tarballs if true. By default both are enabled.

* Our Karaf distribution provides Bouncy Castle at startup. Auto-generated
  feature descriptors take this into account (they won't embed a Bouncy
  Castle dependency).

Feature removals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The ``odl-triemap-0.2`` feature wrapping
  ``com.github.romix:java-concurrent-hash-trie-map`` was rendered obsolete by
  YANG Tools' implementation and has been removed.

Feature additions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``odl-javassist-3`` provides Javassist in a feature.

* ``odl-jung-2.1`` provides `JUNG`_ in a feature.

Upstream version additions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following upstream dependencies have been added to dependency management:

* Commons Text, ``org.apache.commons:commons-text`` (this will allow downstreams
  to migrate from ``commons-lang3``\’s ``WordUtils``, which is deprecated)

Upstream version removals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following upstream dependencies have been removed from dependency
management (they are obsolete and unused):

* Chameleon MBeans
* Eclipse Link
* Equinox HTTP service bridge
* ``equinoxSDK381`` artifacts
* Coda Hale Metrics, which are mostly unused and should eventually be wrapped
  by InfraUtils
* ``com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305`` (which *must not* be used; this is
  enforced — ``annotations`` should be used instead)
* Felix File Install and Web Console
* Gemini Web
* Orbit
* ``org.mockito:mockito-all`` (which *must not* be used; this is enforced —
  ``mockito-core`` should be used instead)
* Spring Framework
* ``txw2``
* Xerces
* ``xml-apis``

Plugin version upgrades
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following plugins have been upgraded:

* ``org.apache.servicemix.tooling:depends-maven-plugin`` 1.3.1 → 1.4.0
* ``org.apache.felix:maven-bundle-plugin`` 2.4.0 → 3.3.0
* ``maven-compiler-plugin`` 3.6.1 → 3.7.0

* ``maven-javadoc-plugin`` 2.10.4 → 3.0.0-M1
* ``maven-shade-plugin`` 2.4.3 → 3.1.0

New plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~

* The `Maven Find Duplicates`_ plugin can be enabled by setting the
  ``duplicate-finder.skip`` property to ``false``.

* The SpotBugs_ Maven plugin can now be used instead of the FindBugs plugin
  (both are available, so no change is required). To use SpotBugs, replace
  ``org.codehaus.mojo:findbugs-maven-plugin`` with
  ``com.github.spotbugs:spotbugs-maven-plugin``.

.. _Maven Find Duplicates: https://github.com/basepom/duplicate-finder-maven-plugin/

.. _SpotBugs: https://spotbugs.github.io/
