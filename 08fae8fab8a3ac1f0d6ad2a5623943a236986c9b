      "message": "Robert, this one is a simple misunderstanding.. indeed in https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d9170 this was clarified. But this change is a Draft/WIP, and I\u0027ve only added you and Stephen so you peek at what I\u0027m cooking up, if interested (feel totally free to remove yourself as a reviewer, if this bothers you!).  So yes absolutely, my plan now very much is to release these EEA to Central; watch https://github.com/lastnpe/eclipse-null-eea-augments/issues/29 about that.  However before that I\u0027m still gaining a bit more experience with using these, e.g. in https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/63838/, and completing many more EEA (possibly automated..), then release, then switch to non-SNAPSHOT here! Voil√†, that\u0027s the story about this... ;-)",
