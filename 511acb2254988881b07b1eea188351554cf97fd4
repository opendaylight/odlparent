      "message": "just picked up on this (sorry I had not yet noticed it before..), this is - curious, in Maven land.  What is this version?  Probably intended as their \"latest\" version, like a SNAPSHOT?  According to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45567787/maven-release-and-latest-version-numbers, this is not (no longer) even really properly supported by Maven.  We do need stable fixed versions to all external dependencies in odlparent.  I don\u0027t know anything about how they findsecbugs-plugin guys release their stuff, but in a quick search on http://search.maven.org find that their latest is the 1.7.1 (from 07-Aug-2017) - so how about we just \u003cversion\u003e1.7.1 instead here?",
