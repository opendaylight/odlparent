      "message": "This should document what the exception means, and what a receiver is supposed to do with it. It might be worth documenting the connection between SystemState.Failure and this — does “something” (what?) being set to SystemState.Failure imply that a SystemStateFailureException will be thrown? If so, what’s the implication of SystemState.Failure? Is there a distinction?",
