      "message": "But without this line, the auto generated BP XML will go into \"OSGI-INF/blueprint/\" instead.  And hand-written ones will remain in org/opendaylight/blueprint.  Therefore they won\u0027t be loaded by the same extender.  Which won\u0027t work.  That was the whole point of why we had the antrun in th first place.  And just moving the hand-written ones from src/main/resources/org/opendaylight/blueprint to OSGI-INF/blueprint won\u0027t work either - because then they will be loaded by the standard BP extender, not by our (your!) custom ODL one - so any RPC and what not extension tags will be ignored.\n\nHow about we stop arguing here and at least pretend like we actually are real engineers and just run builds for changes we make to detect impacts, and actually see failures?  (I cannot participate anymore in this \"hey let\u0027s break some stuff in odlparent and then when projects bump somehow the impacts will be dealt with\" way of working.)",
