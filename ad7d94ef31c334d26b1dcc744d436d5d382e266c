      "message": "Whoa... hang on a sec now - won\u0027t this just completely break any existing BP XML which is manually been put into org/opendaylight/blueprint in many modules in many projects?\n\nMore importantly, our custom BP Extender is not going kick in anymore, to read and process the custom ODL BP XML extension elements - because we look only in \"org/opendaylight/blueprint/ in https://github.com/opendaylight/controller/blob/a6af137c30470b86d4bc624d4c48cb686495a182/opendaylight/blueprint/src/main/java/org/opendaylight/controller/blueprint/BlueprintBundleTracker.java\n\nOr was this change meant to go together with a change to BlueprintBundleTracker in controller?  And a magical UNIX command moving all existing hand written BP XML for all projects when they adopt odlparent 4 ?  Then I could be fine with it.\n\nBut https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/odlparent-dev/2018-August/001915.html seems easier, to me.",
