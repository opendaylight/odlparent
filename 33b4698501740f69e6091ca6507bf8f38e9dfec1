From the mycila-guice parent POM I presume, but it should be documented...\n\nOK; I\u0027ve added a pointer to exactly where this can be checked.\n\n\u003e (Plus, while it\u0027s nice to keep the versions in sync, as long as projects using these for their tests depend on one *or* the other but not both, we should be OK even if the versions diverge.)\n\nNOK; because projects do not depend on one *or* the other but not both, but by depending on mycila-guice-jsr250 implicitly transitively depend on guice also, and if we set another version here which mycila isn\u0027t compatible with, then we would be in trouble.\n\nThis is not theoretical but I\u0027ve run into the problem in practice; note https://github.com/mycila/guice/issues/11",

      "message": "Transitive dependencies aren\u0027t affected by dependency management: if a project depends on mycila, it will get whatever version of guice mycila depends on; if a project depends on guice, it will get the version of guice defined here.

      "message": "Oh OK now I see what you mean.. yes, agreed - in theory. But in practice ultimately even if a project like say testutils from https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/48077/ only needs a dependency to Guice, it will ultimately be used by another project which may, likely, have a dependency to mycila.. so in practice, it would still be a mess - thus best to keep them in sync.",
