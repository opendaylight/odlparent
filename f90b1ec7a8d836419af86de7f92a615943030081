Like which.. Karaf core.. feature.. something actually has the mysql-connector-java as dependency - could we just exclude it there?",

      "message": "Don\u0027t think so, I tried to do that, but it appears that it is a tertiary dependency and doesn\u0027t end up getting excluded from the build.  I added the exclusion to the karaf standard features dependency, and still saw it appear in the system directory-- even with maven-enforcer-plugin set to exclude it as well.\n\nTrying to figure this out in release timeframe is a bit wasteful;  could we get this in as is and then re-evaluate using a more standard plugin than our homegrown one?  I would gladly change the format of this so it isn\u0027t a \"magic String\" as you said earlier?",
