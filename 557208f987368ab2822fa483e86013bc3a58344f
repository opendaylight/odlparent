I did some cursory googling, I think it fixes some issues with interaction between Maven and Eclipse.\n\nBut I do not use Eclipse, and as far as I know we have no jobs to verify interactions with Eclipse.\n\nIs there at least a quick rundown for me to follow, listing which plugins do (not) need this?",
