      "message": "Erm... but this change is a (pure) \"git revert\" - I\u0027m not going to tweak it - that\u0027s not how we do such things?  We broke things (for infrautils) re. blueprint-maven-plugin in 7f6d863443f88fd6102ae2d45d0deeca0e08ddad.  This reverts it so that things work again like before.  https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/75071/ then proposes how to bump it and keep the existing funtionality.  I think you are wanting to suggest an alternative solution?  Then please do go ahead and raise a counter proposal to c/75071 re-introducing what you think needs to be done - but do merge this revert, first?  Or just raise another change which doesn\u0027t revert but fixes things, if you prefer.  But I\u0027m not going to change this revert - that\u0027s not correct, and possibly very confusing in the future.",

      "message": "What? I\u0027ve explained to you why we broke it, in both the commit comment on this change (\"because it breaks infrautils by assuming that all generated\nBP XML must be in org/opendaylight/blueprint... but that is\nactually not an oldparent but controller thing,\nso not valid for and breaking infrautils.\") and on https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/odlparent-dev/2018-August/001912.html, but happy to repeat it here, again: \n\nhttps://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/73672/ breaks things which currently work.   The \"removes a chunk of\nunneeded antrun\" part of that change, which was done in addition to the bump which it advertised, broke things.  That antrun was there for a reason, it was conditional to the presence of src/main/resources/org/opendaylight/blueprint and that change removed that.\n\nIt\u0027s not controller that breaks.  Infrautils of course in theory could do something by overriding that generatedDir back to its default - but as I\u0027ve already expressed on mailing list thread, that is wrong because it worked before and we don\u0027t want to force a downstream project to adapt to a breaking change in odlparent that was made for no strong reason? I mean sure removing the antrun is \"nice\", but we don\u0027t have to do that to bump the blueprint-maven-plugin. I\u0027m trying to understand why you are so hellbent on \"forcing\" the removal of the antrun - anything I am missing which you would like to share?\n\nAnd even more importantlym having to remember to override \u003cconfiguration\u003e\u003cgeneratedDir\u003e in all infrautils projects, more importantly future ones than the existing ones, is going to cause pain down the road.\n\nBut https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/75175/ should do the trick.  I hope we can merge the now 3 changes I have proposed to help you unblock https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/74891/ and move on with our lives.",
