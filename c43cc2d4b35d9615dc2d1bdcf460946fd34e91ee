      "message": "Erm... but this change is a (pure) \"git revert\" - I\u0027m not going to tweak it - that\u0027s not how we do such things?  We broke things (for infrautils) re. blueprint-maven-plugin in 7f6d863443f88fd6102ae2d45d0deeca0e08ddad.  This reverts it so that things work again like before.  https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/75071/ then proposes how to bump it and keep the existing funtionality.  I think you are wanting to suggest an alternative solution?  Then please do go ahead and raise a counter proposal to c/75071 re-introducing what you think needs to be done - but do merge this revert, first?  Or just raise another change which doesn\u0027t revert but fixes things, if you prefer.  But I\u0027m not going to change this revert - that\u0027s not correct, and possibly very confusing in the future.",
