      "message": "This is counter intuitive, especially as the name of the parent is so similar to the name of the test. Also, single-feature-parent comments do not spell this explicitly enough.\n\nMoreover, single-feature-test can be used for creating features other projects depend on, and users can feature:install them directly. For example here [0] a fairly important feature would not get tested on its own, just because features are not aggregated [1] into a single repo.\n\nI think testing single features is generally more important than testing feature repositories (not sure, maybe repo testing is just as good), it is just src/main/feature/feature.xml preventing us from skipping tests on repos.\n\nTesting twice is just a consequence of the inability of SingleFeatureTest to detect which features were tested already. I do not see a good way to avoid double testing just by tweaking feature parents.\n\n[0] https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/38638/13/common/features/odl-yangtools-yang-parser/pom.xml\n[1] https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/38638/13/common/features/pom.xml",
