      "message": "This is counter intuitive, especially as the name of the parent is so similar to the name of the test. Also, single-feature-parent comments do not spell this explicitly enough.\n\nMoreover, single-feature-test can be used for creating features other projects depend on, and users can feature:install them directly. For example here [0] a fairly important feature would not get tested on its own, just because features are not aggregated [1] into a single repo.\n\nI think testing single features is generally more important than testing feature repositories (not sure, maybe repo testing is just as good), it is just src/main/feature/feature.xml preventing us from skipping tests on repos.\n\nTesting twice is just a consequence of the inability of SingleFeatureTest to detect which features were tested already. I do not see a good way to avoid double testing just by tweaking feature parents.\n\n[0] https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/38638/13/common/features/odl-yangtools-yang-parser/pom.xml\n[1] https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/38638/13/common/features/pom.xml",

      "message": "[0] is included in [2], it\u0027s not supposed to be in [1]. [2] does get tested as a result of this change.\n\nI think what we need to ensure is that we test the features that are defined by the projects in their roadmaps. Typically those are the features that are in projects\u0027 feature repositories. (And if they\u0027re not, I\u0027d argue that\u0027s a bug!)\n\nSome projects have feature repositories which take 30 min to run through SingleFeatureTest; I can imagine quite a few developers being rather annoyed if we introduce double testing as a result of this change!\n\n[2] https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/38638/13/common/features/features-yangtools/pom.xml",
