         Base parent POM for building and packaging single Karaf features.
         Karaf features are generated based on the POM dependencies; they can be supplemented by a base
         feature.xml file in src/main/feature.

         By default, such single features aren't tested for loadability; they're supposed to be aggregated
         in a feature repository (see feature-repo-parent), which is tested using SingleFeatureTest. The
         sft profile can be used to enforce SingleFeatureTest on single features too.

         Single features which aren't part of a repository can not be considered part of a project's API.
         In any case, refer to each project's declared features to determine their API and future
         availability.

         Users should do the following:

         - specify this as their parent
         - make sure the packaging is set to feature
         - setup projects <dependencies/> as needed for their features
